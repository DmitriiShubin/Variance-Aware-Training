signal arrays.

def normalize_window(signal, beg=None, end=None):
    """
    Normalizes a window of a 1-D signal array, by substracting the mean of the
    fragment between two indices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal:
        Array containing the signal.
    beg:
        First index of the window to be normalized
    end:
        End of the slice that determines the window length. The last index
        included in the fragment will be (end-1).

    Returns
    -------

    This function performs the same filtering than Zhang in the work: 'An
