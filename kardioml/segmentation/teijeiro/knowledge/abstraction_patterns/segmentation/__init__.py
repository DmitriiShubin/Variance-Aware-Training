Constants of the segmentation package
-------------------------------------

QUAL_THRES:
    This is a heuristically defined threshold on the absolute value of the
    quality indicator of a lead to consider it as 'good'.

QUAL_DIFF_THRES:
    This is a heuristically defined threshold on the difference of the quality
    indicator between two leads that indicates the quality difference is so
    high that one of the leads can be safely ignored.

def characterize_baseline(lead, beg, end):
    """
    Obtains the baseline estimation for a fragment delimited by two time
    points in a specific lead. It also obtains a quality estimator for the
    fragment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lead:
        Selected lead to obtain the baseline estimator.
    beg:
        Starting sample of the interval.
    end:
        Ending sample of the interval.

    Returns
    ------
    out: (baseline, quality)
        Tuple with (baseline, quality) estimators. At the moment, the quality
        estimator is not yet numerically characterized, but we have strong
        evidence that the higher this value is, the higher the signal quality
        of the fragment where the baseline has been estimated.
